    Welcome to Go! a website that allows you to learn how to play and how to win the game Go.
    Go is played by two players on a board that ranges from 9x9 to 19x19. Each player alternates
    placing peices on the board until either a player runs out of peices or both players pass
    their turns. A game is won by getting a higher score, by controlling territory or capturing
    peices.
